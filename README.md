## Summary
The results from this analysis show that the majority of those using CitiBikes are male subscribers. During the weekday most bike use appears to be from those commuting to and from work, as shown by the hours the bikes are being used. On the weekends the bikes appear to be used mostly for afternoon trips around the city. We can also see that most bikes are checked out and returned to more densely populated areas in the city. From this information it may be inferred that in order to best succeed at starting a CitiBike program in Des Moines, Iowa we should put bikes in areas that are more densly populated and close to large places of business. It would also be beneficial to market the subscription service to encourage regular bike use as well as employ specific advertising to target women riders as they seem to be using the bikes less.
